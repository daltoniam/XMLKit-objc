# XMLKit #

Simple little library for parsing XML/HTML entities. Uses GTMNSString for encoding and decoding XML/HTML entities on NSString.

# Requirements #

This framework requires at least iOS 5 above.

# Install #

The recommended approach for installing XMLKit is via the CocoaPods package manager, as it provides flexible dependency management and dead simple installation.

via CocoaPods

Install CocoaPods if not already available:

  ```Shell
  [sudo] gem install cocoapods
  pod setup
  ```
  
Change to the directory of your Xcode project, and create or edit your Podfile and add XMLKit:

  ```Ruby
  platform :ios, '5.0'
  pod 'XMLKit'
  ```

Then run pod install to add to your project.

  `pod install`

Open your project in Xcode from the .xcworkspace file (not the usual project file)
